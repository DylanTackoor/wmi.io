## Whether March comes in like a Lion or a Lamb, when the month finally arrives, we all begin to look forward to Spring and the lovely flowers those warmer temperatures bring.

Let’s focus here on Pollinators: those insects, (like bees and butterflies), birds and critters so important to helping your garden grow. Pollinators move pollen from the male part of the plant to its female part. In doing so, they make **growth** possible.

Hibiscus ‘La France White’

The Lantana, Hibiscus and Anthurium are show stoppers that add beautiful color to your garden while attracting those crucial pollinators.Choose the Lantana in white, purple, yellow, or even confetti (a blast of different colors together). Though the Hibiscus is one of the most common tropical flowers, that doesn’t stop it from being one of our most popular plants. And – so many colors to choose from! Lastly, the Anthurium can be a dramatic addition to your garden in a choice of vibrant shades.

These amazing plants are guaranteed to bring the color you’re looking for in your outdoor scapes, and those all-important pollinators so necessary to a flourishing garden. Happy March!
