title: How do you ship live plants?
---
Once your order is placed we pick the largest plant available in your container size. Sizes vary at different times of the year, so we email you a picture of your plant before carefully packing and prepping it for its journey. Please visit our [Shipping Information](/shipping-plants) page for more information.
