		<h2>Terms of Sale</h2>
		<p>
			By placing an order you are offering to purchase a product and subject to
			the following terms and conditions. All orders are subject to availability
			and confirmation of the order price.
		</p>
		<p>
			Dispatch times may vary according to availability and subject to any
			delays resulting from postal delays or force majeure for which we will not
			be responsible. In order to contract with{' '}
			<Link to='/'>www.PlantVine.com</Link> you must be over 18 years of age and
			possess a valid credit or debit card issued by a bank acceptable to us.{' '}
			<Link to='/'>www.PlantVine.com</Link> retains the right to refuse any
			request made by you. If your order is accepted we will inform you by email
			and we will confirm the identity of the party which you have contracted
			with. This will usually be <Link to='/'>www.PlantVine.com</Link> or may in
			some cases be a third party. Where a contract is made with a third party{' '}
			<Link to='/'>www.PlantVine.com</Link> is not acting as either agent or
			principal and the contract is made between yourself and that third party
			and will be subject to the terms of sale which they supply you. When
			placing an order you undertake that all details you provide to us are true
			and accurate, that you are an authorized user of the credit or debit card
			used to place your order and that there are sufficient funds to cover the
			cost of the goods. The cost of foreign products and services may
			fluctuate. All prices advertised are subject to such changes.
		</p>
		<h3>(a) Our Contract</h3>
		<p>
			When you place an order, you will receive an acknowledgement e-mail
			confirming receipt of your order: this email will only be an
			acknowledgement and will not constitute acceptance of your order. A
			contract between us will not be formed until we send you confirmation by
			e-mail that the goods which you ordered have been dispatched to you. Only
			those goods listed in the confirmation e-mail sent at the time of dispatch
			will be included in the contract formed.
		</p>
		<h3>(b) Pricing and Availability</h3>
		<p>
			Whilst we try and ensure that all details, descriptions and prices which
			appear on this Website are accurate, errors may occur. Do keep in mind
			that certain pictures may represent a more mature version of a plant.
			Also, when ordering within a range of sizes (Ex. 3-5 inches), due to
			different availabilities of each size, we will work hard to provide you
			with the largest size available at the time of order. If we discover an
			error in the price of any goods which you have ordered we will inform you
			of this as soon as possible and give you the option of reconfirming your
			order at the correct price or cancelling it. If we are unable to contact
			you we will treat the order as cancelled. If we cancel your order and you
			have already paid for the goods due to the situation described above, you
			will receive a full refund &amp; will be notified via email describing the
			circumstance.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the event that you need to cancel your order before shipment, you will
			need to call us at <a href='tel:888-361-9998'>888-361-9998</a> within 2
			hours of your order. If for any reason your order has shipped, in that
			window, you will not be able to cancel. If your order is canceled before
			it ships within that window, you will receive a full refund. If the order
			ships, then you will need to follow the return policy steps. See our
			return policy for further instructions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Delivery costs will be charged in addition; such additional charges are
			clearly displayed where applicable and included in the ‘Total Cost’.
		</p>
		<h3>(c) Payment</h3>
		<p>
			Upon receiving your order we carry out a standard authorization check on
			your payment card to ensure there are sufficient funds to fulfil the
			transaction. Your card will be debited upon authorization being received.
			The monies received upon the debiting of your card shall be treated as a
			deposit against the value of the goods you wish to purchase. Once the
			goods have been dispatched and you have been sent a confirmation email the
			monies paid as a deposit shall be used as consideration for the value of
			goods you have purchased as listed in the confirmation email.
